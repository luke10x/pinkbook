## 1. Spot transactions

## 2. Outright forward transations

## 3. Foreign Exchange swaps (Most popular)

FX Swap has two legs:

- A Spot transction;
- and a Forward transaction;

executed simultaneously.

UK company receives EUR from sales in Europe
The company also has to pay EUR to supplyers in Europe
Right now they having domestic expenses in GBP

They could:
- Spot sell EUR and buy GBP right now and cover their domestic expenses
- Spot sell GBP and buy EUR again and pay the suplyer

But in this case if UK economy has problems and GBP/EUR rate goes down
they would have to spend a lot more GBP to buy back the same amount of EUR they currently have
This is why they have an exposure risk.

To **mitigate this risk** they could better - 
They create a 1M Swap, which means they simultaneously:

- Sell EUR & buy GBP on spot
- and sell GBP & buy EUR on 1M forward

The company now knows for sure they will be able to pay EUR for supplier,
and they also can operate domesticaly paying their current expenses in GBP

**Cost of Foreign Exchange Swaps** is calculated like that:

$$
F=
S \left(\frac
    {1+ r_d \cdot T}
    {1 + r_f \cdot T}
\right)
$$

- F = forward rate
- S = spot rate
- r<sub>d</sub> = simple interest rate of the term currency
- r<sub>f</sub> = simple interest rate of the base currency
- T = tenor (calculated according to the appropriate day count convention)

## 4. Options

FX options are used to hedge uncertain future cash flows in a foreign currency (Similarly like Frowards).

Use Forward when: cash flow is certain;
Use Option when: cash flow is not certain.


## 5. Currency Swaps 



## 6. Others

Non Deliverable Forward Contracts
Option-dated forward contracts
