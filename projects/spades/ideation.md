# Ideation

Out of many Spades card game apps 
there is only one web app worth attention:
https://cardgames.io/spades/

It can be still improved in several ways

## Customer Pain points / pain reliefs:

- Cannot chat own words
  - Can chat if logged in
- When humans are quiting it can spoil game
  - after second timeout forced move others can vote eviction
  - reputation grows by continuing somebody elses games

- It does not have mobile/touch app
  - PWA installaable on web, mobile first design

- Not indicating whos turn is and time remaining
- not indicating available moves
- Not showing bids clearly during the game
  - Make ui more like zynga poker with clear state indication
   - Indicate available moves clearly

- No QR invitations, social share invite links
  - Invitation using QR and Social links
  - buddies online can already be added to new tables

- lots of advertisement
  - remove adds after registration
  - remove adds for labour - following unfinished games
  - Show adds only when waiting on other player
    (and is obvious that it opens in new window)
  - add shows when game is ended
  - use interstitial adds more

- Navigates to Hearts app in a middle of the game
  - Ensure you cant accidently click on something, "confirm leave" 

- Cannot play with same people again
  - add "buddies" like in Zynga Poker

## Gains:

- onboarding like zynga spades+
- interactive helper giving tips (maybe just criticizing after move)
- result graph showing points change over time
- Integrate with voice call
