And over the weenend...

✅ Tamed Web Workers in react app for Spades  
📌 Ended up using worker-plugin/loader wo/ adding to Next cfg  
📌 Couldnt find how to load SharedWorker using worker-loader  
📌 SharedWorker seems to load fine using Webpack>=5 syntax  
> But that is not cool to have different way of loading different  workers.
> Webpack5 syntax issue with normal Workers has to do with TS.
