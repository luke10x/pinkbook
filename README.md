Log of building in public
=========================

I work on my side projects for (the goal is) 
at least 1 hour a day. While doing streams on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/10x_developer).

Specifically, I am working on a project that is a web app to play card game Spades.
Which is the most popular non-gambling card game in the US.

This [Pinkbook](?meta) is a live journal of the progress.
